## Writeup
Beginning the challenge, I used the command `nc cha.hackpack.club 10992` to interact with the CTF. After initiating a connection, a long string of text is outputted before an interactive game appears. Based on the characteristics of the string (i.e., equal signs at the end of the string), I knew the text was likely Base64 encoded.
