# Self-Hosted-Crypto
***Disclaimer: I solved this challenge after the CTF challenges became unavailable, though without a writeup.***
## Details
- Category: Reverse Engineering
- Flag: `flag{A_b4d_Id34!1!}`
- Synopsis:
	- Reverse engineer `encrypter` binary to understand how the program scrambles text.
	- Write a script to convert the encrypted flag to its original state via a ROT-13 cipher.
## Writeup
The challenge provides two files, `encrypter` (a go-compiled binary), and the `encrypted` flag.

Opening up `encrypter` in IDA-Pro Home, I viewed the `main_main` function, then decompiled the function using IDA-Pro's `generate pseudocode` feature using the `f5` shortcut.

From inspecting the generated code, it appears that the binary's encryption process involves running a for-loop for each character in a file appending `13` to the character's decimal value, then writing the conversions to `encrypted`.

To test whether this theory works, I passed a text file to the binary containing "abc", then attempted to reverse the encryption process.

Sure enough, the encrypter functions as a classic ROT-13 cipher!

While inputting the encrypted flag to a ROT-13 cipher may seem convenient, much of the characters in the file are not readable, meaning that some python scripting is required to seamlessly solve the challenge.

Using the output from hexdump, I appended the contents to a python file and converted the encrypted string back to it's original form, resulting in the flag!

Below, includes my solution for the challenge, `solve.py`.


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import ast

encoded_flag_hex = "73 79 6e 74 88 4e 6c 6f 41 71 6c 56 71 40 41 2e 3e 2e 8a".split(" ")
encoded_flag_decimal = []
flag = []

# Convert hexadecimal characters to decimal
for i in range(len(encoded_flag_hex)):
	encoded_flag_decimal.append(ast.literal_eval("0x" + encoded_flag_hex[i]))

# Remove 13 from each decimal value.
for i in encoded_flag_decimal:
	flag.append(i-13)

# Convert decimal notation to ASCII
for i in range(len(flag)):
	flag[i] = chr(flag[i])

print(''.join(flag))
```
